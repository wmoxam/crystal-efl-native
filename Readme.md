# [EFL/Elementary](http://enlightenment.org) native bindings for [Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/)

**This is a work in progress.**



These bindings are 'native' in the sense that there is no intention of
making this library follow Crystal conventions.

For now the aim is not to provide full API coverage, rather coverage of the
most commonly used functions.
